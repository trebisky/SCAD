Side note - when I went to do this after an upgrade to Fedora 38,
Cura would not start (version 5.3.0).  A bit of searching told me
I could get something called the "Cura 5.3.1 AppImage" from Github.
I searched for this and downloaded it, placing it under /home/tom/Cura
I had to "chmod a+x" this thing (it is huge, 240M, probably some
containerized Cura).  But it works!  Maybe when 5.3.1 reaches the
Fedora packages the problems will be fixed.

** I make a link to this in /home/tom/bin called "cura2"

------------------------------

This Readme copied from the "helmet" project.

Vblock generates a V-block that can be used to clamp a 1 inch tube
in a vise or some similar arrangement.

How to do this:

1 - edit vblock.scad

1.5 - use openscad in GUI mode to view the model
    Use F6 to "render", then F7 to export STL

1.6 - (just type "make" to get vblock.stl)

3 - use "cura" to go from stl to gcode.

    -- save some time and insert the flash card
       before starting Cura.

    -- double check settings
       Creality Ender-3 Pro, Generic PETG, 0.4 nozzle
       50 percent infill, 245/80 temperatures, 0.2mm layers

    -- Do not use File --> New Project to get started!
	(this will reset to 215/70 temperatures)
    -- Use File --> open file to open "vblock.stl"
    -- I select 100 percent infill.

    -- then push the big blue "slice" button at lower right
    -- then push the "save to disk" button that replaces it.

3.1 - a note on Cura.  If I plug in my card reader before starting Cura,
    and mount the drive, Cura will just offer to write to removeable drive.
    This is convenient (but it generates an odd filename).
    It generates CE3PRO_vblock.gcode in this case.

3.2 - Cura does set head and bed settings!
    Bring down the print settings menu and find Material.
    In there are the print temperature and bed temperature.
    The default was 215 and was making me crazy.
    I set 245 and 70.

4.0 I am using blue Hatchbox PETG

4.1 adhesion on painters tape is bad, should clean with isopropyl first.

4.2 - off to the printer.  Insert the card upside down.
    If you haven't used the printer in a while,
	clean the bed with alcohol.

    Honestly, "print from TF" is all you need.
    The printer will heat everthing up and home
    the axes without being told to do so.

    But here are the details from before I knew it was this simple:

    No need to  autohome the axes, the gcode will command this
     when the print starts.
    Select prepare --> preheat ABS (I am now using PETG).
     (probably no need for this either, it will heat to the
      settings in the gcode file before starting the print
    wait for it to get to 245/80
     (the temperatures in Cura are 245/80, but I don't know how
      to change the default "ABS" temperature in the printer,
      but starting at 240 works, the printer heats the
      extruder up to the 245 in the gcode file before
      starting the print)
    Then "print from TF card", refresh, then select file

I had a warped print with my new PEI bed using 245/70.
I changed (in Cura) to 245/80 and fan 50 rather than 100
I also turned of the AC to eliminate the draft.
This turned out nicely.
Some people run the bed as high as 90 with PETG.
NOTE: the preheat for ABS brings the bed up to 70C.
When the printer starts to print from TF, it recognizes that
80C is requested and doesn't start the print until the bed is
at the specified temperature.

Cura tosses all your settings unless you take pains to save them in a profile
I did so, creating a "Standard Quality PETG" profile.
This wasted a huge amount of my time.

Once you have a profile and want to change what is permanently saved,
click on the "star", then find the "update profile with current settings" button.
This menu also lets you change the name (I changed to PETG standard).

I restart Cura to ensure that it knows how to save my settings.
I check:
    Infill (20 or 100)
    Material (245/80)
    Cooling (fan 50)
    Support (checked, touching buildplate, normal, zig-zag
